    ### BPMN diagrams Comparison ###
    A critical component of your analysis involves a thorough comparison of BPMN diagrams before and after the detection of concept drift, necessitating a solid grasp of BPMN symbols. 
    Such understanding is crucial for identifying structural changes within the diagrams, including modifications in sequences, parallelisms, conditional flows, loops, and silent transitions.
    Understand BPMN Symbols: Sequential fragments are denoted by '->', parallel fragments by '+', conditional fragments by 'X', looping fragments by '*', and silent transitions by 'tau'. 
    Nested fragments are enclosed in parentheses '()'. 


# concept_drift_analysis: |
#     ### Analysis ###
#     First step: Meticulously analyze the variations in activities and transitions, with a keen focus on the addition or removal of activities and transitions. 
#     Second step: Compare the BPMN diagrams identifying each differences between them and understanding the impact in the process flow, especially regarding sequences, parallelisms, conditional flows, loops, and silent transitions.
#     Third step: Summarize all analysis and make a final conclusion about the main change and the main activities involved.
# Third step: Conclude whether a concept drift occurred, which specific change pattern has occurred (the most likely), and which activities are involved.
# The analysis should extend to understanding:
# - Transitions and Activities Modifications: Scrutinize the introduction of new transitions and the absence of certain transitions or activities. Assess the implications of these changes on the overall process flow.
# - Statistical Significance of Transition Changes: Examine transitions that exhibit notable alterations in their probability and frequency, aiming to decode the underlying shifts they signal within the process dynamics.

    ### Change pattern classification ###
    First step: Compare the BPMN diagrams identifying each differences between them and understanding the impact in the process flow, especially regarding:
     - Changes in fragments such as sequences, parallels, and conditionals.
     - Changes in activities positions.
     - Changes in loops and silent transitions ('tau').
     - Changes in the activity relationships. 
    Second step: Analyze each new and deleted transition understanding the impact in the process flow, especially regarding if it is making any activity become skippable or non-skippable.
    Third step: Conclude whether a concept drift occurred and identify the most significant or impactful change pattern that has occurred. Focus on this primary change pattern for your analysis. Also, identify which activities are involved.  
    Approach this task methodically, focusing on accuracy and evidence to support your conclusions.
    Format your conclusion as follows, providing a clear and concise verdict on whether the change pattern is present: 
    '### result_dict = {'concept_drift' : ['No'], 'change_pattern' : ['None'], 'activities' : ['None']} 
    or '### result_dict = {'concept_drift' : ['Yes'], 'change_pattern' : ['pattern_acronym'], 'activities' : ['A', 'B']}.

#         This indicates that before the drift, activity 'B' and 'C' frequency were similar, while after the drift, they were different. 
#         In other words, before the drift, the frequency of activities 'B' and 'C' had not statistical difference, and after the drift, theirs frequencies had statistical difference. 
#         Note: In such scenarios, the involved activities hasn't any control-flow difference before and after the drift, only the branch frequency or branch probability have difference. 
#         Tip: Investigate activities which are in XORs (X) fragments, and transitions which are in Changed_transition_probability or Changed_transition_frequency but is not in Transitions_new or Transitions_deleted.

#     ### Change Patterns Rules ###
#     1. Activity Addition or Deletion
#         Changes in activities are significant indicators of concept drift. Categorize these changes as follows:
#             - Replace (RP): When a new activity substitutes a deleted activity in the same sequence, indicating a direct replacement.
#                 - Example: Transitioning from ->(A, B, C) to ->(A, D, C) signifies a replacement of activity B with D.
#             - Serial Routing Enablement (SRE): Introduction of an activity within a sequential flow, enhancing the linear process flow.
#                 - Example: Expanding ->(A, B) to ->(A, C, B) introduces C into the sequential flow between A and B.
#             - Parallel Routing Enablement (PRE): Insertion of an activity within a parallel flow, suggesting an augmentation to handle tasks concurrently.
#                 - Example: Modifying ->(A, B, C) to ->(A, +(B, D), C) indicates the introduction of activity D in parallel to B.
#             - Conditional Routing Enablement (CRE): Addition of an activity within a conditional (XOR) flow, introducing a new decision point.
#                 - Example: Changing ->(A, B, C) to ->(A, X(B, D), C) adds a new conditional route involving D.

#     2. Transition Addition or Deletion
#         Transitions reflect the movement between activities. Their addition or deletion without altering activities suggests changes in process dynamics.
#             - Serial Move (SM): Reordering of activities within a sequential flow.
#                 - Example: ->(A, B, C, D, E) evolving to ->(A, C, D, B, E) demonstrates a serial repositioning of B.
#             - Parallel Move (PM): Shifting an activity to/from a parallel structure, reflecting a change in concurrent processing.
#                 - Example: ->(A, B, C, D, E, F) adjusted to ->(A, C, D, +(B, E), F) shows B and E moving to a parallel configuration.
#             - Conditional Move (CM): Transitioning an activity into/out of a conditional flow.
#                 - Example: ->(A, B, C, D, E, F) changing to ->(A, C, D, X(B, E), F) signifies B and E entering a conditional pathway.
#             - Swap (SW): Two activities exchanging positions with corresponding transition adjustments.
#                 - Example: ->(A, B, C, D, E, F) transforming to ->(A, E, C, D, B, F) indicates a swap between B and E.
#             - Conflict (CF) & Parallel (PL) Changes: Modifying BPMN fragment types to address or remove conditional or parallel decision-making.
#                 - Examples: Changing ->(A, X(B, C), D) to ->(A, B, C, D) (CF) or ->(A, +(B, C), D) to ->(A, B, C, D) (PL) reflects structural reconfiguration.
#             - Control Dependency or Synchronization (CD): Adjusting the sequence of parallel activities to synchronize or sequence their execution.
#                 - Example: ->(A, +(B, ->(C, D)), E) evolving to ->(A, ->(+(B, C), D), E) demonstrates a reorganization for synchronization.
#              - Loop (LP): This pattern identifies a shift where activities previously part of a repetitive (looping) sequence are rearranged to either form a new loop or eliminate an existing one. This change emphasizes the alteration in the process's iterative aspects.
#                 - Example: Transitioning from ->(A, *(B, C, D), E) to ->(A, B, C, D, E) removes the loop, indicating a significant modification in how B, C, and D are processed repetitively.
#             - Copy (CP): The Copy pattern is observed when an activity sequence is replicated within the same process flow, suggesting redundancy or the need for repetition without establishing a formal loop structure.
#                 - Example: Adjusting ->(A, B, C, D) to include a direct repetition, such as ->(A, B, C, A, D), implies a copying of the A activity sequence, thereby introducing a pseudo-repetitive task without the typical loop notation.
#             - Conditional Bypass (CB): This intricate pattern occurs when a new transition enables the process to skip an activity that was previously mandatory, introducing a conditional pathway that bypasses certain steps.
#                 - Example: Altering the flow from ->(A, B, C) to ->(A, X(B, null), C) introduces a conditional decision point where B can be entirely bypassed, significantly affecting the sequence's execution dynamics.

#     3. Transition Changes Only (Frequency - FR)
#         When transitions exhibit statistically significant alterations in probability or frequency without any addition or deletion of activities or transitions, classify these changes as Frequency (FR) modifications.


 # To determine whether a concept drift has occurred and identify the specific change pattern, one would need to analyze the BPMN diagrams and transitions before and after the suspected drift. Since I don't have access to actual BPMN diagrams or transition data, I can't provide a real analysis. However, I can illustrate how you might approach this task using hypothetical examples.

# Let's assume you have two BPMN diagrams representing the process before and after the change, and you've noticed differences in the sequences and transitions of activities. Here's how you might analyze the change:

# 1. **Identify Changes in Activities and Transitions**: Look for any new or deleted activities and transitions in the BPMN diagrams. This will help you determine if there's been an addition, deletion, or movement of activities.

# 2. **Analyze the Sequence and Parallelism**: Examine the flow of activities to see if there's been a change from sequential to parallel execution or vice versa.

# 3. **Check for Conditional Changes**: Look for any new or removed XOR gateways that would indicate a change in conditional routing.

# 4. **Look for Loops and Branching**: Identify any changes in loops or conditional branching that would affect the frequency or skippability of activities.

# 5. **Compare Frequencies**: If frequency data is available, compare the branching frequencies before and after the change to see if there's been a significant shift.

# Based on these steps, you might conclude the following:

# - If you find an activity that was not present before and is now added in a sequence, it could be an SRE pattern.
# - If an activity is added in parallel with existing activities, it could be a PRE pattern.
# - If an activity is added or removed from a conditional branch, it could be a CRE pattern.
# - If an activity appears twice in the sequence where it previously appeared once, it could be a CP pattern.
# - If an activity is replaced by another, it could be an RP pattern.
# - If two activities have switched places, it could be a SW pattern.
# - If an activity has moved to a new position in the sequence without being duplicated or replaced, it could be an SM pattern.
# - If an activity has moved into or out of a conditional branch, it could be a CM pattern.
# - If an activity has moved into or out of a parallel branch, it could be a PM pattern.
# - If activities that were previously in a XOR relationship are now sequential, or vice versa, it could be a CF pattern.
# - If activities that were previously in a parallel relationship are now sequential, or vice versa, it could be a PL pattern.
# - If there's a structural reorganization affecting the sequence or dependency among activities, it could be a CD pattern.
# - If activities that were previously non-loopable are now loopable, or vice versa, it could be an LP pattern.
# - If an activity becomes skippable or non-skippable, it could be a CB pattern.
# - If the frequency of branching changes without control-flow changes, it could be an FR pattern.
