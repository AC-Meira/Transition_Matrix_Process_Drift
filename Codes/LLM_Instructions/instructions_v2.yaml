    ### BPMN Informations ###
    Understand BPMN Symbols: Familiarize yourself with the BPMN symbols used in the diagrams.
    Sequential fragments are denoted by '->', parallel fragments by '+', conditional fragments by 'X', looping fragments by '*', and silent transitions by 'tau'. Nested fragments are enclosed in parentheses '()'. 
    Compare BPMN Diagrams: You are given two BPMN diagrams representing the process flow before and after the detection of concept drift. 
    Carefully compare these diagrams to identify any structural changes in the fragments such as sequences, parallelisms, conditional flows, loops, and silent transitions.

    - sre_instructions: >
        The 'SRE' (Serial Routing Enablement) involves the addition or deletion of one or more activities in or from a sequential flow. 
        For example, the sequence could change from '->(A, B)' to '->(A, C, B)' or vice versa, where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are activities, and '->' symbolizes sequential flow. 
        This scenario implies that after the drift, activity 'A' is inserted in the process and in a sequential flow between other two activities, 
        in this case 'A' and 'B', or it could be deleted from the process and from a sequential flow between two other activities. 
        Tip: In such scenarios, it's advisable to delve deeper and investigates if the BPMN information shows differences in Sequences (->) fragments. 
        This scenario involve the addition and deletion of activities and transitions, so look if activities and transitions are inserted and deleted.
    - pre_instructions: >
        The 'PRE' (Parallel Routing Enablement) involves the addition or deletion of one or more activities in or from a parallel branch. 
        For example, the sequence could change from '->(A, B, C)' to '->(A, +(B, D), C)' or vice versa, where 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' are activities, '->' symbolizes sequential flow, and '+' represents an AND or parallel operation within the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). 
        This scenario implies that after the drift, activity 'D' is inserted in the process and in a parallel branch, or 'D' could be deleted from the process and from a parallel branch. 
        Tip: In such scenarios, it's advisable to delve deeper and investigates if the BPMN information shows new or deleted ANDs (+) fragments. 
        This scenario involve the addition and deletion of activities and transitions, so look if activities and transitions are inserted and deleted.
    - cre_instructions: >
        The 'CRE' (Conditional Routing Enablement) involves the addition or deletion of one or more activities in or from a conditional branch. 
        For example, the sequence could change from '->(A, B, C)' to '->(A, X(B, D), C)' or vice versa, where 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' are activities, '->' symbolizes sequential flow, and 'X' represents a XOR or conditional operation within the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). 
        This scenario implies that the drift, activity 'D' is inserted in the process and in a conditional branch, or 'D' could be deleted from the process and from a conditional branch. 
        Tip: In such scenarios, it's advisable to delve deeper and investigates if the BPMN information shows new or deleted XORs (X) fragments. 
        This scenario involve the addition and deletion of activities and transitions, so look if activities and transitions are inserted and deleted.
    - cp_instructions: >
        The 'CP' (Copy) involves duplicate an existing activity of the process to another location in the process. 
        For example, the sequence could change from '->(A, B, C, D)' to '->(A, B, C, A, D)' or vice versa, where 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' are activities, '->' indicates a sequential operation. 
        This scenario implies that after the drift, activities 'A' appears in another location in the process as well. 
        Note: Identifying this pattern can be challenging, especially because neither the BPMN diagrams nor the transitions information may be correctly identified the duplication of an activity. 
        Both informations may only show that the duplicated activity has new transitions or maybe identify the duplication as a loop. 
        Tip: In such scenarios, it's advisable to delve deeper and investigates the new transitions. 
        Using the previous example, activity 'A' would have a new transition from activity 'C' ('C', 'A') and a new transition to activity 'D' ('A', 'D'). 
        These two new transitions should be understood as a new addition between 'C' and 'D', and, consequently, identified the duplication of 'A'.
    - rp_instructions: >
        The 'RP' (Replace) involves the replace of one or more activities by other new activities. 
        For example, the sequence could change from '->(A, B, C)' to '->(A, D, C)', where 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' are activities, '->' symbolizes sequential flow. 
        This scenario implies that after the drift, activity 'B' is replaced by activity 'D', which are a new activity in the process.

        This scenario implies that after the drift, activity 'B' is swapped with activity 'E'. 
        Tip: In such scenarios, it's advisable to delve deeper and investigates if the BPMN information may shows the activities in different locations in the process, both occupying the exact position of the other, 
        and if both involved activities have new and deleted transitions. This scenario DOESN'T involve activities addition or deletion.
    - sm_instructions: >
        The 'SM' (Serial Move) involves move an existing activity to between two existing activities. 
        For example, the sequence could change from '->(A, B, C, D, E)' to '->(A, C, D, B, E)', where 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E' are activities, '->' symbolizes sequential flow. 
        This scenario implies that after the drift, activity 'B', which was between activities 'A' and 'C', is moved to between activities 'D' and 'E'.

        and 'X' represents a XOR or conditional operation within the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). 
        This scenario implies that after the drift, activity 'B', which was between activities 'A' and 'C', is moved to between activities 'D' and 'F' and in a conditional branch with activity 'E'. 
        Tip: In such scenarios, it's advisable to delve deeper and investigates if the BPMN information may shows the activity in different locations in the process, shows new or deleted XORs (X) fragments, 
        and if the involved activity have new and deleted transitions. This scenario DOESN'T involve activities addition or deletion.
    - pm_instructions: >
        The 'PM' (Parallel Move) involves move an existing activity into or out of a parallel branch. 
        For example, the sequence could change from '->(A, B, C, D, E, F)' to '->(A, C, D, +(B, E), F)', where 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', and 'F' are activities, '->' symbolizes sequential flow,

        and if the involved activity have new and deleted transitions. This scenario DOESN'T involve activities addition or deletion.
    - cf_instructions: >
        The 'CF' (Conflict) involves making activities initially mutually exclusive to be sequential, or vice versa. 
        For example, the sequence could change from '->(A, X(B, C), D)' to '->(A, B, C, D)' or vice versa, where 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' are activities, '->' indicates a sequential operation, 
        and 'X' represents a XOR or conditional operation within the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). 
        This indicates that before the drift, activities 'B' and 'C' were mutually exclusive, suggesting that only one could occur in any process instance, while after the drift, they have become sequential, implying a fixed order of execution. 
        Tip: In such scenarios, it's advisable to delve deeper and investigates if the BPMN information shows new or deleted XORs (X) fragments, and if the involved activities have new and deleted transitions. 
        This scenario DOESN'T involve activities addition or deletion.

        This indicates that before the drift, activities 'B' and 'C' were parallel, suggesting that both would occur with no defined order between them, while after the drift, they have become sequential, implying a fixed order of execution. 
        Tip: In such scenarios, it's advisable to delve deeper and investigates if the BPMN information shows new or deleted ANDs (+) fragments, and if the involved activity have new and deleted transitions. 
        This scenario DOESN'T involve activities addition or deletion.
    - cd_instructions: >
        The 'CD' (Control Dependency) change pattern indicates a structural reorganization affecting the sequence or dependency among activities in a business process. 
        It highlights the transformation of activities from parallel to sequential execution or vice versa, and the reordering of tasks within parallel branches. 
        Key indicators include: 
        1. Sequentialization or Parallelization - Transitioning activities between parallel and sequential execution, altering their dependencies. 
        2. Reordering Within Branches - Modifying the order of activities within parallel branches to establish new execution precedents. 
        3. New Control Dependencies - Introducing, removing, or altering transitions that redefine interconnections among activities, aimed at process optimization or adapting to new business requirements. 
        In BPMN analysis, look for modifications in activity sequencing and transitions that signal shifts in task dependencies or workflow restructures, aimed at enhancing process efficiency or meeting evolving operational demands.
    - lp_instructions: >
        The 'LP' (Loop) involves making activities initially loopable to be non-loopable, or vice versa. 
        For example, the sequence could change from '->(A, *(B, C, D), E)' to '->(A, B, C, D, E)' or vice versa, where 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E' are activities, '->' indicates a sequential operation, 
        and '*' represents a loop operation within the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). 
        This indicates that before the drift, activities 'B', 'C', and 'D' were in a loop, while after the drift, they were not in a loop. 
        Tip: In such scenarios, if the BPMN information doesn't show the loop, it's advisable to delve deeper and investigates if deleted transitions led to activities that could lead to the activity in question, which define a loop in the process.
    - cb_instructions: >
        The 'CB' (Conditional Branching) pattern identifies changes in whether activities within a business process are optional (skippable) or mandatory (non-skippable).
        Quick Guide: 
            - Skippable Activity: An activity that can be bypassed based on conditions. Look for the addition of XOR (X) gateways that introduce a path skipping the activity.
            - Non-Skippable Activity: An activity that must always be executed. Check for the removal of XOR gateways that previously allowed skipping.
        Identifying CB Changes:
            - Examine XOR Changes: Focus on new, removed, or altered XOR gateways in the BPMN diagram. These indicate potential changes in skippability.
            - Review Transitions: Analyze new or deleted transitions closely. A new direct path that skips an activity suggests a change to skippable.
            - Assess Activity Paths: Determine if an activity has become optional or mandatory by the presence or absence of alternative paths around it.
    - fr_instructions: >
        The 'FR' (Frequency) involves change the branching frequency of activities without any changes in the control-flow. 
        For example, the sequence could change from '->(A, X(B[550], C[450]), D)' to '->(A, X(B[700], C[300]), D)' or vice versa, where 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' are activities, '->' symbolizes sequential flow, 
        'X' represents a XOR or conditional operation within the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), and the information inside the '[]' represent the activity frequency. 
        This indicates that before the drift, activity 'B' and 'C' frequency were similar, while after the drift, they were different. 
        In other words, before the drift, the frequency of activities 'B' and 'C' had not statistical difference, and after the drift, theirs frequencies had statistical difference. 
        Note: In such scenarios, the involved activities hasn't any control-flow difference before and after the drift, only the branch frequency or branch probability have difference. 
        Tip: Investigate activities which are in XORs (X) fragments, and transitions which are in Changed_transition_probability or Changed_transition_frequency but is not in Transitions_new or Transitions_deleted.

    ### Change Patterns Rules ###
    1. Activity Addition or Deletion: there are new or deleted activities in the process. 
        For example: - New activities added to the process: ['A', 'B'] - Deleted activities from the process: ['C', 'D']. 
        - If the new activity replaces the deleted activity in the exact same location, classify as RP (Replace). For example: '->(A, B, C)' to '->(A, D, C)'. 
        - If the activity was part of a sequential flow, classify as SRE (Serial Routing Enablement). For example: '->(A, B)' to '->(A, C, B)'. 
        - If the activity was part of a parallel flow (+), classify as PRE (Parallel Routing Enablement). For example: '->(A, B, C)' to '->(A, +(B, D), C)'. 
        - If the activity was part of a XOR flow (X), classify as CRE (Conditional Routing Enablement). For example: '->(A, B, C)' to '->(A, X(B, D), C)'. 

    2. Transition Addition or Deletion: no activity is added or deleted but there are new or deleted transitions in the process.
        For example: - New activities added to the process: ['None'] - Deleted activities from the process: ['None'] - New transitions added to the process: [('A', 'B')] - Deleted transitions from the process: [('B', 'C')].
        - Movement Patterns: an activity changes BPMN fragments, requiring both new and deleted transitions, classify based on the new structure.
            - Sequential (→) as SM (Serial Move). For example: '->(A, B, C, D, E)' to '->(A, C, D, B, E)'.
            - Parallel (+) as PM (Parallel Move). For example: '->(A, B, C, D, E, F)' to '->(A, C, D, +(B, E), F)'.
            - XOR (X) as CM (Conditional Move). For example: '->(A, B, C, D, E, F)' to '->(A, C, D, X(B, E), F)'.
            - If two activities swap positions with identical transition adjustments, classify as SW (Swap). For example: '->(A, B, C, D, E, F)' to '->(A, E, C, D, B, F)'.
            
        - Fragment Type Changes: two activities change BPMN fragment types together.
                - From/to XOR (X) as CF (Conflict). For example: '->(A, X(B, C), D)' to '->(A, B, C, D)'.
                - From/to Parallel (+) as PL (Parallel). For example: '->(A, +(B, C), D)' to '->(A, B, C, D)'.

        - Synchronization: two parallel activities are now sequential within the same parallel fragment, or one is immediately outside the fragment.
            - Classify as CD (Control Dependancy or Synchronization). For example: '->(A, +(B, ->(C, D)), E)' to '->(A, ->(+(B, C), D), E)'.

        - Loop Fragment Changes: new or deleted BPMN LOOP fragments, classify based on transition changes.
            - With deleted transitions in the LOOP, classify as CP (Copy). For example: '->(A, B, C, D)' to '->(A, B, C, A, D)'.
            - Without deleted transitions, classify as LP (Loop). For example: '->(A, *(B, C, D), E)' to '->(A, B, C, D, E)'.

        - Conditional Bypass: there are activities with new transition enables another activity to be skipped.
            - Classify as CB (Conditional Branching or Skip). For example: '->(A, B, C)' to '->(A, X(B, null), C)'.

    3. Transition Changes only: there are ONLY transitions with statistically significant alterations in probability or frequency, with NO activity being added or deleted, and NO transition being added or deleted. 
        For example: - New activities added to the process: ['None'] - Deleted activities from the process: ['None'] - New transitions added to the process: ['None'] - Deleted transitions from the process: ['None'].
        - Classify as FR (Frequency). For example: '->(A, X(B[550], C[450]), D)' to '->(A, X(B[700], C[300]), D)'.
