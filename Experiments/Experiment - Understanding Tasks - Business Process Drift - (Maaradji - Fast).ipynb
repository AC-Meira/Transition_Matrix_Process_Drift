      "     - This is supported by the new transitions added to the process: `('Assess_eligibility', 'Send_home_insurance_quote')` and `('Assess_eligibility', 'Send_acceptance_pack')`, which indicate a more structured approach to handling these activities.\n",

The activities 'Prepare_acceptance_pack' and 'Check_if_home_insurance_quote_is_requested' have been grouped together in sequence before the conditional fragment. This confirms the presence of concept drift.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 2: Identify the Change Pattern ####\n",
      "Given the structural change, we need to classify the change pattern using the pre-defined patterns:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Serial Move (SM):**\n",
      "   - The activities 'Prepare_acceptance_pack' and 'Check_if_home_insurance_quote_is_requested' have moved into a sequence.\n",
      "   - Evidence: Sequence (->) fragment changed in BPMN diagram comparison.\n",
      "   - Both new and deleted transitions involving the moved activities.\n",

      "2. **Conditional Move (CM):**\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Parallel Move (PM):**\n",
      "   - The activities have not moved into a parallel (+) fragment.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Swap (SW):**\n",
      "   - Multiple activities have not swapped positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Parallel (PL):**\n",
      "   - No change from sequential to parallel or vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Conflict (CF):**\n",
      "   - No change from sequential to conditional or vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Control Dependency (CD):**\n",
      "   - No reordering within a parallel (+) fragment.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Conditional Branch (CB):**\n",
      "   - The new transitions suggest that 'Prepare_acceptance_pack' and 'Check_if_home_insurance_quote_is_requested' have become skippable.\n",
      "   - Evidence: New conditional (X) fragment and new transitions making activities skippable.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Copy (CP):**\n",
      "   - No new or deleted loop fragment with conditional (X) and silent transition ('tau').\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Loop (LP):**\n",
      "    - No new or deleted loop fragment.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 3: Determine the Most Significant Change Pattern ####\n",
      "The most significant change pattern is **Conditional Branch (CB)**, as the new transitions `('Assess_eligibility', 'Send_home_insurance_quote')` and `('Assess_eligibility', 'Send_acceptance_pack')` make 'Prepare_acceptance_pack' and 'Check_if_home_insurance_quote_is_requested' skippable.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Change in Parallel Fragment:**\n",
      "   - **Before Drift:** The parallel fragment includes 'Appraise_property' and a nested sequential fragment '->( 'Check_credit_history', 'Assess_loan_risk' )'.\n",
      "   - **After Drift:** The parallel fragment includes 'Appraise_property' and 'Check_credit_history' as separate parallel activities. The 'Assess_loan_risk' activity has been moved out of the parallel fragment and placed sequentially after it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Change in Sequence:**\n",
      "   - **Before Drift:** 'Assess_loan_risk' is part of the nested sequential fragment within the parallel fragment.\n",
      "   - **After Drift:** 'Assess_loan_risk' is now a standalone activity that follows the parallel fragment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Changes ###\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Parallelism Adjustment:** The 'Check_credit_history' and 'Assess_loan_risk' activities were initially executed in sequence within a parallel fragment. After the drift, 'Check_credit_history' is executed in parallel with 'Appraise_property', and 'Assess_loan_risk' is executed sequentially after the parallel fragment.\n",
      "- **Sequential Flow Adjustment:** The movement of 'Assess_loan_risk' from within the parallel fragment to a position after it indicates a change in the control flow, potentially reflecting a reordering of tasks to optimize the process or address a new business requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "These changes suggest a significant restructuring of the process flow, likely aimed at improving efficiency or addressing new operational constraints. The movement of 'Assess_loan_risk' out of the parallel fragment and into the main sequential flow could indicate a need to ensure that risk assessment is completed only after both property appraisal and credit history checks are done independently.\n",

      "2. **Change in Sequence:**\n",
      "   - **Before Drift:** 'Assess_loan_risk' is part of the nested sequential fragment within the parallel fragment.\n",
      "   - **After Drift:** 'Assess_loan_risk' is now a standalone activity that follows the parallel fragment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Insights from Detailed Data ###\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Control-Flow Changes\n",
      "- **Transitions with variations in probability and frequency** indicate that the process flow has been altered, affecting how often certain transitions occur.\n",
      "- **Deleted transitions** such as ('Assess_loan_risk', 'Appraise_property') and ('Appraise_property', 'Assess_eligibility') confirm the restructuring of the process flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Movements of Activities\n",
      "- The movement of 'Assess_loan_risk' from within the parallel fragment to a position after it is confirmed by the absence of the transition ('Assess_loan_risk', 'Appraise_property') in the detection window.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Adjustments in Loops\n",
      "- No explicit loops are mentioned in the BPMN diagrams or detailed data, so no adjustments in loops are inferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Skippability of Activities\n",
      "- No new or deleted transitions suggest changes in skippability directly. However, the restructuring of the parallel and sequential flows might indirectly affect the skippability of activities, particularly 'Assess_loan_risk', which now must be completed after both 'Appraise_property' and 'Check_credit_history'.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion ###\n",
      "\n",
      "The BPMN diagram analysis is accurate and aligns with the detailed data provided. The primary changes involve the restructuring of the parallel fragment and the movement of 'Assess_loan_risk' to a sequential position after the parallel activities. This restructuring likely aims to ensure that risk assessment is completed only after both property appraisal and credit history checks are done independently, potentially improving the process's efficiency and reliability.\n",

      "- The primary change observed is in the conditional fragment handling the acceptance pack and home insurance quote. Initially, either `Send_acceptance_pack` or `Send_home_insurance_quote` was executed based on a condition. After the concept drift, both activities are executed sequentially without any conditional check.\n",

      "Based on the provided analysis, it is clear that there is a significant change in the business process. The transition from conditional to sequential execution of `Send_acceptance_pack` and `Send_home_insurance_quote` indicates a concept drift.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 2: Identify the Change Pattern ####\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Control-Flow Changes:**\n",
      "   - The conditional fragment `X` has been altered to a sequential execution.\n",
      "   - This aligns with the **CF (Conflict)** pattern, where two connected activities change from a conditional (X) fragment to sequential execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Activity Movement:**\n",
      "   - The activities `Send_acceptance_pack` and `Send_home_insurance_quote` have moved from being conditionally executed to being sequentially executed.\n",
      "   - This further supports the **CF (Conflict)** pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Skippability of Activities:**\n",
      "   - The activity `Send_home_insurance_quote` is no longer skippable, aligning with the **CB (Conditional Branch)** pattern.\n",
      "   - However, the primary change is the shift from conditional to sequential execution, which is more indicative of the **CF (Conflict)** pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 3: Identify Involved Activities ####\n",
      "The activities involved in the change pattern are `Send_acceptance_pack` and `Send_home_insurance_quote`.\n",

      "   - **After Drift:** The parallel fragment is replaced by a looping fragment `*` that contains a conditional fragment `X` with multiple activities ('Assess_eligibility', 'Send_acceptance_pack', 'Send_home_insurance_quote', 'Assess_loan_risk', 'Verify_repayment_agreement', 'Check_if_home_insurance_quote_is_requested', 'Appraise_property', 'Prepare_acceptance_pack', 'Check_credit_history') and a silent transition `tau`.\n",

      "### Summary ###\n",
      "The BPMN diagrams before and after the concept drift show significant changes in the control flow, particularly in the handling of parallel and conditional activities. The introduction of a looping fragment with a conditional structure and a silent transition indicates a more flexible and potentially more efficient process, allowing for the skipping of certain activities. This change could be aimed at optimizing the process by reducing unnecessary steps and handling different scenarios more dynamically.\n",

      "These findings indicate that the concept drift is likely related to changes in the execution dynamics rather than structural modifications. Further investigation into the reasons behind these variations, such as changes in business rules, external conditions, or resource allocation, would be necessary to fully understand the concept drift.\n",

      "1. **Investigate Decision-Making Criteria**: Examine if there have been changes in the criteria or policies governing the decision at 'Check_if_home_insurance_quote_is_requested'.\n",
      "2. **Analyze External Factors**: Look into external factors that might influence the choice between 'Send_acceptance_pack' and 'Send_home_insurance_quote'.\n",

      "   - There are no explicit loops mentioned in the detailed data, but the introduction of 'tau' and parallelism can create implicit loops where activities can be revisited or skipped.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Insight:** The flexibility introduced by 'tau' can create scenarios where activities are revisited or skipped, effectively creating implicit loops.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Step 1: Confirm Concept Drift ####\n",
      "Based on the provided analysis, there is a clear indication of a concept drift. The process has shifted from a sequential execution model to a more flexible and parallel execution model. This is evident from the introduction of the silent transition ('tau') and the new transition 'Assess_eligibility' to 'Check_credit_history'.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 2: Identify the Change Pattern ####\n",
      "Given the detailed analysis and the BPMN diagrams comparison, the most significant change pattern can be identified as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Parallelism and Conditional Flows:**\n",
      "   - The activities 'Check_credit_history', 'Appraise_property', 'Assess_loan_risk', and 'Assess_eligibility' are now part of a conditional fragment within a parallel fragment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Introduction of Silent Transition (tau):**\n",
      "   - The inclusion of 'tau' within the parallel fragment suggests that some activities can be skipped entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **New Transition:**\n",
      "   - 'Assess_eligibility' to 'Check_credit_history' is a new transition added to the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 3: Classify the Change Pattern ####\n",
      "Based on the predefined change patterns, the most significant change pattern is **Conditional Branch (CB)**. This pattern is characterized by making a non-skippable activity become skippable or vice versa, which aligns with the introduction of 'tau' and the new transition 'Assess_eligibility' to 'Check_credit_history'.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 4: Identify Involved Activities ####\n",
      "The activities involved in this change pattern are:\n",
      "- 'Assess_eligibility'\n",
      "- 'Appraise_property'\n",
      "- 'Assess_loan_risk'\n",

      "#### Step 1: Identify Concept Drift ####\n",

The primary change observed is the removal of the parallel fragment involving the activities `'Appraise_property'`, `'Check_credit_history'`, and `'Assess_loan_risk'`. These activities, which were previously executed in parallel, are now executed sequentially. This change indicates a concept drift.\n",

      "\n",
      "The observed change involves moving activities from a parallel fragment to a sequential order. This fits the **Parallel (PL)** pattern, as the activities `'Appraise_property'`, `'Check_credit_history'`, and `'Assess_loan_risk'` were previously in a parallel fragment and are now in a sequential order.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Change Pattern Classification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **SM (Serial Move):**\n",
      "   - Not applicable as the activity moved into a parallel fragment, not a sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **CM (Conditional Move):**\n",
      "   - Not applicable as the activity moved into a parallel fragment, not a conditional fragment.\n",

      "3. **PM (Parallel Move):**\n",
      "   - Applicable as 'Prepare_acceptance_pack' moved into a parallel fragment with 'Send_home_insurance_quote'.\n",
      "   - Evidence:\n",
      "     - Parallel (+) fragment changed in BPMN diagram comparison.\n",
      "     - Both new and deleted transitions in the list of variations involving the moved activity ('Prepare_acceptance_pack').\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **SW (Swap):**\n",
      "   - Not applicable as there is no swapping of multiple activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **PL (Parallel):**\n",
      "   - Not applicable as the change involves moving an activity into a parallel fragment, not changing the connection type between two activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **CF (Conflict):**\n",
      "   - Not applicable as there is no change from sequential to conditional or vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **CD (Control Dependency):**\n",
      "   - Not applicable as there is no reordering of activities inside a parallel fragment.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **CB (Conditional Branch):**\n",
      "   - Not applicable as there is no change in skippability due to a new or deleted conditional fragment.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **CP (Copy):**\n",
      "   - Not applicable as there is no new or deleted loop fragment with a conditional fragment and a silent transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **LP (Loop):**\n",
